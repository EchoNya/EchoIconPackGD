# How to download

# How to uninstall
If you don't know how to remove those icons: go into steam > library > right click on GD > properties > Installed files > Verify integrity of game files (first close your game) then restart GD and all icon should be like before.

# How to request icons

There's 2 ways to submit an icon:

### 1. Creating an issue.
This is probably the most slower (im kinda inactive on github)
Just create an issue [here](https://github.com/EchoLazzatore/EchoIconPackGD/issues) with the label "Request Icon".
Submit details of the icon, like: ***How should it be*** or ***What in game icon should it change*** and if possible add an image representing it.

### 2. Texting me on Discord.
The most efficent way (since im always online) and its a lot easier:
Just dm me (echodasillyx3) and tell me about the details above (still, you can give an image representing the icon) and it might be added to the pack
# SUBMITTING RULES
**EVERY ICON BEING SUBMITTED NEEDS TO FOLLOW SOME RULES**:
NO NSFW (u already know why)
NO SPAM (spamming issues or dms, js wait lmao)
